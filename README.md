# checkout-cart

The purpose of this application is to display a simple checkout cart

Things to do: 
- Based on items in cart, nudge the “customer” to add another (or 2) of the more valuable
types to cart and complete their bundle.
- display related items

Little Side Notes:
- Because of CORS error user may need to refresh a few times to let the proxy server work it's magic. 

- Overrided CORS error took some grinding.  "https://api.jsonserve.com/8A9Dga" returns 500 error. 

- The JSON sample data images didn't seem to pull through for the products. Tried featured_images as well as images.
